Simple chat webapplication written in Python and runable on a Flask webserver.
For this to work, LMStudio is also needed and set in server mode. Only LLM tested so far i GPT-OSS.

The purpose of the application is to demonstrate two AI bots having a conversation. The user will initite the conversation with a topic,
and the bots will then discuss the topic. The bots behaviours are also set in the application, and conversations can get quite interesting.
